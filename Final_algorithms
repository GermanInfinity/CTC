GREEDY ALGORITHM
An approach for solving a problem by selecting the best option available at the moment.
works in a top-down approach, can be used in problems with these properties: 
greedy choice, can solve problem with present solution without considering best choice
optimal substructure, if optimal overall solution corresponds to optimal solution
to subproblems
advantages: easier to describe, may perform better than others in some cases
disadvantages: does not always give optimal solution
algorithm: start with empty set, consider possible solution till solution is found,
once item is unfeasible do not consider again 


DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING
Dynamic Programming is a technique in computer programming that helps to efficiently solve a class of problems that have overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure property.
Overlapping subproblems: solutions to subproblems depend on other subproblems
Optimal substrucutre: optimal solution reached from optimal solutions to subproblems
We can store solutions to other subproblems in memry, to avoid recomputation

DP typically applied to recursive solutions, but not all recursive algorithms use
DP, unless there are overlapping subproblems


BACKTRACKING
Problem solving algorithm that uses a brute force approach for finding the desired
output. Approach tries out all possible solutions and chooses the best solution. The
term backtracking, suggests if the current solution is not suitable, then backtrack
and try other solutions, does not guarantee optimal solution. 
Can be represented with a state space tree.
