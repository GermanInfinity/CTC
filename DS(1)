STACK
Last - In - First - Out 
stack of plates; operations: push, pop, peek, isFull, isEmpty

Complexities: 
push: O(1)
pop: O(1)


Applications: reverse a word 
              compiler calculation 2 * 3 in prefix or postfix form
              browser navigation


QUEUE
First - In - First - Out
line at grocery; operations: enqueue, dequeue, peek, isEmpty, isFull
Complexities: 
enqueue: O(1)
dequeue: O(1), can be O(n) depending on where front is

Applications: CPU scheduling, 
              Can be use dofr synchronization in asynchronous processes
              Call center to hold people in order

Types: Circular, priority
Priority queue: each elemenet has value associated with priority, elements can be
removed from front of based on their priority. Implemnented with heap

DEQUEUE
doubly insert or removal queue; operations can happen at front or end of queue
all operations are in O(1) time.
