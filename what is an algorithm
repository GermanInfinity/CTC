what is an algorithm
In computer programming terms, an algorithm is a set of well-defined instructions
to solve a particular problem. 
qualities: clear, unambigious, input and output properly defined,
           effective among many different ways to solve, no computer 
           code


What are data structures
Data structure is a storage that is used to store and organize data. It is a way of arranging data on a computer so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently.
Linear data structure (arranged in straight line): stack, queue, array, linked lists

Non-linear structure (arranged in hierachy, one element to many): 
divided into graph and trees
both have vertices and edges, but graphs may have multiple edges between vertices.
trees only have one edge between vertices/nodes. 

differences: 
memory: non-linear strucutre utilize memory depending on need
        linear structure not efficient use of memory 
time complexity: non-linear structure time-complexity remains the same
                 lincear structure increases with data size
layers and runs: different layers, multiple runs to see all elements
                 single layer, one single run to see all elements


Efficiency of algorithm 
Depends on time, storage and other resource required to execute algorithm 
Asypmtotic analysis- study of change in perfromance of an algorithm 
Neither sorted or reverse array takes average time
Big oh - worst case performance
Omega  - best case performance
Theta - average case performance 

Divide and conquer algorithm 
strategy for solving large problem by; breaking problem into smaller sub-problems,
solving the sub problem and combining solutions for desired output
recursion required to use. 

Divide - Conquer (solve) - Combine

diff to DP: does not store solutions to sub-problems
            use when same subproblem not solved multiple times

advantages: time complextiy of 2 matrix mult N**3, with divide conquer N**2.8
            simplifies tower of hanoi problem 
            efficient use of memory cache
