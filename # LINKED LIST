# LINKED LIST 

# Sum between two linked lists
# ensure we have result, carry
# can use dummy node for resulting ll
# while p1 or p2; result is carry
# add values for each pointer, move pointer
# set new ll with result = result % 10 and carry = result // 10 
# at end check for carry and add to ll


# Detect cycle 
# create fast and slow, fast at next
# while fast and fast.next
# check if match
# else move fast to next next and slow to next
